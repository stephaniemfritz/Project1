While NVIDIA's volatility suggests a higher risk profile and sensitivity to market sentiment, the more stable performance of Google and Microsoft points to their established market presence and potentially less direct impact from short-term AI-specific news.  Meta's upward trend highlights the potential for positive investor perception of AI-related initiatives, while the mixed performance of other companies suggests a complex interplay of factors beyond just AI.  It's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this short-term analysis and recognize that these 30-day trends may not be indicative of long-term performance or fundamental company strength. Further investigation, including analysis of trading volume, news sentiment, and company-specific events, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers behind these stock price movements.

## Sentiment Analysis
### News Sentiment Analysis Over Time

This analysis examines the evolution of news sentiment surrounding Deepseek over a three-week period in 2025 (W03, W04, W05).  Each news article was processed, and a compound sentiment score was generated using the Vader sentiment analyzer. Articles were classified as "positive," "negative," or "neutral" based on their compound sentiment scores.

The distribution of sentiment across news articles for weeks 3, 4, and 5 of 2025 is shown below: 
| Week       | Negative | Neutral | Positive |
|------------|----------| --------| ---------|
| 2025 - W03 |       50 |      50 |       50 |
| 2025 - W04 |      1300|    2000 |     1200 |
| 2025 - W05 |       100|     150 |      100 |

To assess whether the proportion of neutral articles varied significantly across these weeks, we performed a z-test for proportions. The results are as follows:
* **Week 4 vs. Week 3:** The p-value for the difference in the proportion of neutral articles is 0.0035. This indicates a statistically significant difference, suggesting that the proportion of neutral articles was higher in week 4 compared to week 3.
* **Week 5 vs. Week 4:** The p-value for the difference in the proportion of neutral articles is 0.7176. This indicates no statistically significant difference between these two weeks.

The significant increase in neutral articles in week 4 suggests a shift in media coverage, potentially reflecting broader or more nuanced reporting on Deepseek's activities. The lack of significant change between weeks 4 and 5 indicates that this shift in neutral coverage stabilized. 

We also utilized a stacked bar chart and pie chart to visualize the distribution of negative, neutral, and positive sentiment.  The stacked bar chart reveals a significant shift in sentiment distribution across the three weeks.  Week 3 shows a relatively balanced distribution, with a roughly equal count of negative, neutral, and positive articles.  However, week 4 exhibits a dramatic increase in both negative and neutral articles, while positive articles remain relatively constant.  This suggests a potential shift in media coverage, possibly reflecting increased scrutiny or a broader range of perspectives on Deepseek's activities.  By week 5, while the absolute counts are lower, the proportion of neutral articles remains dominant, indicating a sustained trend towards more balanced or objective reporting.  The noticeable increase in neutral sentiment between weeks 3 and 4, and its continued dominance in week 5, warrants further investigation into the specific events or news topics driving this shift.  Correlating these sentiment changes with Deepseek's announcements, product launches, or industry developments during this period would provide valuable context and a deeper understanding of the factors shaping public perception.

### Conclusion
This research explored Deepseek's influence on the AI market by examining stock price performance, trading volume, and news sentiment over time.  Our analysis revealed several key findings.  
* Firstly, NVIDIA's stock price and trading volume significantly outperformed other AI-related companies, highlighting its dominant position and investor focus within the AI chip market.  
* Secondly, news sentiment surrounding Deepseek shifted from a relatively balanced distribution in week 3 to a predominantly neutral stance in weeks 4 and 5, potentially reflecting increased scrutiny or a broader range of perspectives on Deepseek's activities.  However, it's important to note that the sentiment analysis covers a period that includes Deepseek's January 2025 announcement, limiting our ability to isolate the specific impact of this event.   
* Finally, while other AI companies exhibited varying degrees of stock performance and trading volume, none approached the magnitude of NVIDIA's activity, underscoring the unique market dynamics surrounding this key player.

### Limitations
This research has several limitations. The 30-day timeframe for stock price and sentiment analysis may not be representative of long-term trends. Specifically, the limited timeframe following Deepseek's January 2025 announcement restricts our ability to fully assess the announcement's impact on market sentiment and stock performance. The sentiment analysis, while informative, is based on a limited dataset of news articles and may not fully capture the breadth of public opinion.  Additionally, correlating Deepseek's activities with stock market reactions is challenging due to the multitude of factors influencing stock prices.  While we observed potential relationships, establishing definitive causality requires further investigation.  Finally, the selection of AI companies analyzed, while relevant, is not exhaustive and may not fully represent the entire AI landscape.

### Additional Analysis (Future Research)
With additional time, several avenues of research could enhance this analysis.  Expanding the timeframe for stock price and sentiment analysis, particularly extending the analysis further beyond the Deepseek announcement,  would provide a more comprehensive view of long-term trends.  Incorporating social media sentiment (e.g., from Twitter) could offer a more nuanced understanding of public perception.  A deeper dive into the specific news content driving sentiment changes, through topic modeling or thematic analysis, would provide valuable insights into the factors shaping public opinion about Deepseek.  Furthermore, exploring the competitive landscape and comparing Deepseek's performance and public perception to its direct competitors could provide a more contextualized assessment of its influence within the AI market.  Finally, a more rigorous statistical analysis, potentially including regression modeling, could help quantify the relationship between Deepseek's activities and market reactions, moving beyond observed correlations towards a more robust understanding of causality.
